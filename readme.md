# Bucket fill challenge
A submission for virtual mini hackathon challenge (I'm a joint winner! :tada:)

[The link to the challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11qIH9Aih7MwOG9TbilbPZqQneUYmj3fd/edit)

## Getting Started
Simply run the app.py file and enter your custom test input in the terminal.

The first line of your test input should contain an integer, h, that denotes the height of the picture and the number of elements in picture.
Each line i of the h subsequent lines (where 0 â‰¤ i < h) contains a string that describes picture[i].

For example:

STDIN | Function
--- | --- |
3 | picture[] size h = 3
aaaba | picture = [ "aaaba"]
ababa | picture = [ "aaaba" , "ababa"]
aaaca | picture = [ "aaaba" , "ababa" , "aaaca" ]

Once done, the terminal will output the result.
